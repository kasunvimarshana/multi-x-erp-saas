# POS (Point of Sale) Module - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The POS module is a comprehensive Point of Sale system that manages the complete sales workflow from quotations to invoices and payments. It follows Clean Architecture principles with strict separation of concerns.

## Architecture

### Design Pattern: Repository → Service → Controller

```
Controllers (Presentation)
    ↓
Services (Business Logic)
    ↓
Repositories (Data Access)
    ↓
Models (Domain Entities)
```

## Database Schema

### Tables Created

1. **quotations** - Sales quotations before orders
2. **quotation_items** - Line items for quotations
3. **sales_orders** - Customer sales orders
4. **sales_order_items** - Line items for sales orders
5. **invoices** - Customer invoices
6. **invoice_items** - Line items for invoices
7. **payments** - Payment records

### Key Relationships

- Customer → Multiple (Quotations, Sales Orders, Invoices, Payments)
- Sales Order → Single Invoice
- Invoice → Multiple Payments
- Quotation → Can convert to Sales Order
- All entities are tenant-scoped for multi-tenancy

## Features Implemented

### 1. Quotations
- Create, read, update, delete quotations
- Convert quotations to sales orders
- Track validity period
- Automatic quotation numbering (QUOT-XXXXXX)
- Line item management with pricing calculations

### 2. Sales Orders
- Full CRUD operations
- Order status workflow: DRAFT → QUOTATION → CONFIRMED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED → INVOICED
- Stock reservation on confirmation
- Stock release on cancellation
- Integration with Inventory module
- Automatic order numbering (SO-XXXXXX)
- Customer and warehouse assignment

### 3. Invoices
- Create invoices manually or from sales orders
- Track invoice status: DRAFT → PENDING → PARTIALLY_PAID → PAID → OVERDUE
- Automatic calculation of totals
- Payment tracking
- Due date management
- Automatic invoice numbering (INV-XXXXXX)

### 4. Payments
- Record payments against invoices
- Multiple payment methods supported
- Automatic invoice status updates
- Payment voiding with reason tracking
- Reference number for electronic payments
- Automatic payment numbering (PAY-XXXXXX)

## Business Logic

### Quotation Workflow
1. Create quotation with line items
2. Send to customer (event-driven notification)
3. Customer accepts → Convert to sales order
4. Customer rejects → Mark as cancelled

### Sales Order Workflow
1. Create order (from quotation or manually)
2. Add line items with products, quantities, prices
3. Confirm order → Reserve stock in inventory
4. Process order → Prepare items
5. Complete order → Ready for invoicing
6. Generate invoice → Create invoice from order

### Invoice Workflow
1. Create invoice (from sales order or manually)
2. Send to customer (event-driven notification)
3. Receive payment → Record payment
4. Update invoice status automatically
5. Full payment → Mark as PAID

### Stock Integration
- On sales order confirmation: Stock is reserved (negative movement)
- On sales order cancellation: Stock is returned (positive adjustment)
- Complete integration with Inventory module's StockMovementService

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Events
1. **QuotationCreated** - Triggered when quotation is created
2. **SalesOrderCreated** - Triggered when order is created
3. **SalesOrderConfirmed** - Triggered when order is confirmed
4. **InvoiceCreated** - Triggered when invoice is created
5. **PaymentReceived** - Triggered when payment is recorded

### Listeners (All Async via Queue)
1. **NotifyCustomerOfQuotation** - Send quotation to customer
2. **NotifyCustomerOfSalesOrder** - Notify customer of new order
3. **NotifyCustomerOfInvoice** - Send invoice to customer
4. **NotifyCustomerOfPaymentReceipt** - Send payment receipt
5. **UpdateInvoicePaymentStatus** - Update analytics and accounting

## Transaction Safety

All write operations use database transactions:
- Create, update, delete operations
- Stock movements integrated transactionally
- Automatic rollback on errors
- Ensures data consistency

## Multi-Tenancy

All models use the `TenantScoped` trait:
- Automatic tenant_id assignment
- Queries automatically scoped by tenant
- Complete data isolation between tenants

## Validation

Controllers implement comprehensive validation:
- Required field validation
- Data type validation
- Foreign key validation
- Business rule validation
- Range validation for numeric fields

## Pricing Calculations

Each line item supports:
- Base price (unit_price × quantity)
- Discount percentage
- Discount amount
- Tax percentage
- Tax amount
- Line total calculation
- Document-level totals

## Security

- All endpoints require authentication (`auth:sanctum` middleware)
- Tenant isolation ensures data security
- Soft deletes preserve audit trail
- Validated inputs prevent injection attacks

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Needed
- Service layer business logic
- DTO transformations
- Enum behavior methods
- Model calculations

### Integration Tests Needed
- API endpoints
- Database transactions
- Event dispatching
- Stock integration

### Feature Tests Needed
- Complete workflows (Quotation → Order → Invoice → Payment)
- Status transitions
- Permission checks

## Future Enhancements

1. **Receipt Generation**
   - PDF receipt generation
   - Email delivery
   - Print formatting

2. **Invoice Printing**
   - PDF invoice generation
   - Customizable templates
   - Multiple format support

3. **Payment Gateway Integration**
   - Stripe, PayPal integration
   - Card processing
   - Automatic payment recording

4. **Sales Returns**
   - Return authorization
   - Credit note generation
   - Stock return processing

5. **Advanced Reports**
   - Sales analytics
   - Payment reports
   - Customer statements
   - Aged receivables

6. **Recurring Invoices**
   - Subscription billing
   - Automatic invoice generation
   - Payment reminders

## Dependencies

- Laravel 12
- Inventory Module (for stock integration)
- CRM Module (for customer data)
- IAM Module (for user authentication)

## Performance Considerations

- Eager loading relationships to avoid N+1 queries
- Indexed database columns for fast queries
- Pagination for large datasets
- Queue processing for async tasks
