## Architecture Compliance

### Clean Architecture ✅

**Separation of Concerns**:
- **Composables**: Reusable business logic (11 composables)
- **Services**: API communication layer (9 services)
- **Stores**: Centralized state management (6 Pinia stores)
- **Components**: Pure UI presentation (27 components)
- **Utils**: Helper functions and constants

**SOLID Principles**:
- ✅ Single Responsibility: Each component/composable has one clear purpose
- ✅ Open/Closed: Extensible through props, slots, and events
- ✅ Liskov Substitution: Components can be swapped with compatible interfaces
- ✅ Interface Segregation: Focused, minimal prop interfaces
- ✅ Dependency Inversion: Components depend on abstractions (composables)

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:
- ✅ Reusable composables for common patterns
- ✅ Shared UI components across modules
- ✅ Centralized utilities and helpers
- ✅ Generic entity system for consistent CRUD

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**:
- ✅ Clear, readable code with descriptive naming
- ✅ Straightforward component APIs
- ✅ Minimal prop complexity
- ✅ Self-documenting code structure
